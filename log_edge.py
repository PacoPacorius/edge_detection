def log_edge(in_img_array: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Accepts the input grayscale image in_img_array and outputs resulting
    binary image with values 0 or 1. Edge pixels will be assigned a
    1, pixels that do not belong to an edge get assigned a 0.
    This function has to call the FIR convolution function.
    Edge detection using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator.

        Input grayscale image

    Returns:
